# patreon-discord-bot

A Patreon discord bot CLI app. This helps hand out roles at the start of the month and remove roles that users should
not have.

Make sure your bot has admin permissions in your discord server.
Also, ensure your bot has members intent enabled in the discord developer portal.

Check out the [Patreon API](https://docs.patreon.com/#introduction) for more information on how to get required
credentials and information.

Create a configuration.json file with the required information.
